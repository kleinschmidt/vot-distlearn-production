# JS Aadapt Demo

This is a fully worked replication of an audio-visual speech adaptation study (with some extensions), which we ran over Mechanical Turk.  It contains as a subtree the `js-adapt` javascript core code, which exists as its own repository [here](https://bitbucket.org/dkleinschmidt/jadapt).
